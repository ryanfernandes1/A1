<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<img src="image_6487327.JPG" alt="Student ID" width="300px">
  <p>I am Ryan Fernandes, a student enrolled at RMIT University, however to RMIT I am S3947718. This is how I am presented on the student ID card. I am a first year Uni student in 2022, that completed year 12 last year, which to be honest was one of the toughest years of my life. Completing VCE in the middle of a worldwide pandemic was a nightmare in which it seemed as if there was no escape. I somehow managed to make it through and here I am, beginning my journey into university. With all the let-downs and lessons of the previous two years I am excited to see what these next few will bring.
  </p>


  <p>My family is from the country known as India, specifically along the coast of Southern India, in Mangalore, Karnataka. My parents moved to Melbourne, Australia in June of 2003, being fluent in a language not utilised by many, known as ‘Konkani’ from their motherland. They migrated practically blindly to the other side of the world to a foreign country with hopes and aspirations of creating a ‘better life’ for their children, with the help of their siblings. Around one month after settling in to Melbourne, I was born on the 1st of August 2003, the newest addition to the Fernandes family alongside my five-year-old brother at the time. Since then, I have lived in Melbourne or Werribee for the majority of my 18 years of life, which have been as average as can be growing up in the west-side of Melbourne. </p>

  <p>I can speak one language fluently, which is English, and Konkani partially, which is enough to get by with my relatives. However, I can understand Konkani and Hindi quite well due to always being exposed to the languages within my family. If you can’t tell by now I am big on family, or ‘family first’ as my father would say. </p>

  <p>Other then that, my main interests are basketball and the NBA (National Basketball Association), but also rap music.  Ever since I can remember basketball has been a part of my life, from playing on the rec league teams to playing for leisure, it has been an outlet for myself for whatever I am dealing with in life. It has provided me with year-long friendships and has never let me down. Not only do I love to play basketball but I am also a huge fan of the NBA in the US. My favourite player would have to be the 2017 MVP of the league Russell Westbrook who is currently on the roster for the Los Angeles Lakers which is my favourite team.
  </p>

  <p>One of my other passions is music, whether it is listening or creating, music brings me joy no matter the mood I am in. I have loved rap since I was around 12 years old and I heard my first Kanye West song from my big brother Roy. I have indulged within the rap game since then, listening to artists such as J.Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, and Lil Baby to name a few. After learning & appreciating these artists lyrics for years, I have been able to pick up a couple of things myself, enabling me to make some songs oof my own. Now none of these tracks have been released as of yet but I am featuring on a song with my cousin A. Jace. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0t34OYdIDkHrZJMgY4UtOi?si=j9jpWp8wS2SoeeE1tuiiBw&nd=1"target="_blank">Click Here To Visit A.Jace's Spotify</a>
  </p>

  <p>My passions and hobbies, paired with my creative thinking have opened up a few ideas for my IT project which will be discussed further along in the report.
  </p>


<h2>Interest in IT</h2>


  <p>Throughout my years in high-school, especially towards the last few years, I was actively trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life. I was often bombarded with the question ‘what do you want to be?’. In my honest opinion, I feel it is almost impossible to completely comprehend exactly what an individual wishes to partake in as an occupation for the rest of their lives within their adolescence. For those who do know what they want, they have probably been inspired heavily by their parents or other daily influences. However, without trying something, it is usually very difficult to know whether an individual would enjoy it or not. This is precisely why finding what I wanted to pursue in life was difficult as I had little to no experience in any of the courses offered at nearby tertiary education institutes. After discussing with some of my relatives and family friends I learnt about the field of IT. I had no experience in the field, but I was interested in the direction the field was developing into. Specifically, how technology is an ever-growing platform that assists and connects people from all over the world. For myself, it was never what I wanted to be in life, but what is my purpose in life. So I knew my aim was to assist as many people as possible throughout life, and I realised last year that this could be sustained with a job in the IT field. Also, I was told by many, that jobs in IT aren’t too difficult to find, that many of the jobs are 9-5 and only on weekdays, that the salary for IT jobs are comfortable and sufficient for my goals in life. Also that within the IT field the customers mostly come to the employee and not vice versa.
  </p>

  <p> At the moment I have a job in the LG (Life’s Good) solar battery recall department, which I attend on Mondays and Wednesdays, meamning I have practically no experience in IT. That’s why I am interested in learning as much as possible about IT in the time that I can, as I feel that it is essential to learn as many things as possible, not only to better myself but also for those around me. I have one cousin that has his masters in IT, who quickly gave it up to become a full time painter and now is a builder, so that isn’t too much of a help. However, there is one person who has sparked my interest in IT. This man is another relative of mine who is my oldest cousin, Steve. Steve is a financial planner with an occupational history of bank management and insurance sales. He is one of my mentors, who assists me with outcomes of big decisions within my life. Together, we narrowed down my options based off what courses I could get into in regard to prerequisites and which courses I didn’t like. We had three options left, the most appealing being IT as it met my standards for a job in the future. Then Steve arranged for me to meet some IT specialists, which are some of his friends who really helped me understand what it is like to study and have a career in IT. I talked to an IT Security Manager at Vanguard about what day to day things are like, the certificates that are needed in IT and aspects such as salary and work hours.
 </p>

  <p>I chose to come to RMIT for numerous reasons. Firstly I chose RMIT because a few of my friends from high school were going to RMIT as well, on diplomas and bachelors degrees, and even though it was advised not to do this, I assumed it would make the transition to Uni life easier. However, I chose RMIT for the ease of accessibility, as I can get on the train from Werribee straight to MC in about 40 minutes, and RMIT is right there. Whereas other Universities require more time to travel to and have overall longer travel times. From all the people that I know who have attended or attend RMIT I have heard nothing but good things. RMIT also had the most courses that were appealing for me to study incase I wanted to change courses. I wanted to go to RMIT as well for it’s big campus and social life, which I felt was a good fit for me. Which is also a down point as navigating through the buildings can be a pain. It presented a good opportunity to meet people I have never met before and get out of my regular social circle. There are other features that attracte me too, such as the state library, basketball courts and Melbourne Central.
  </p>

  <p>I expect to learn what life at uni is like in my time at RMIT. I expect to learn enough to meet prerequisites and certifications for jobs. I expect to have a good idea of what the field of IT consists of, including all the areas that interest me. I expect to learn what I don’t like and what I do like about IT and RMIT. But mainly, I expect to learn what I want to do with my life and something that can help me to fulfil my purpose in life. </p>


<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<img src="IDEAL JOB.png" alt="My Ideal Job" width="400px">

    <p> <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56310805?type=standout#sol=ecf7da234a2cd383b96510db15673af195865975"target="_blank">Click Here To View Ideal Job Advertisement</a>


    This Cyber Security Manager position entails the occupation of working at a recruitment technology company in the Brisbane CBD, Queensland. This role involves managing, of course, a cyber security department for a company to protect it’s business, data and certification while avoiding any leakages or miscommunication of any company information. The manager occupation is appealing to me as I feel that some of the strongest qualities that I possess align nicely with those of a manager. I like this position because of the flexibility involved, including working from home and in the office, which I feel is necessary to stay engaged in the role. Also the job is based in Brisbane, which is a place I have always wanted to live in, plus the company is International so travelling is a possibility for the job which is always nice. Obviously, another engaging upside to the job is the salary, which Seek states the average wage is 150 - 180 thousand dollars per year. </p>

  <p>As the manager of the cyber security, the role requires qualities such as leadership, responsibility, innovation, coordination & teamwork as well as communication skills. Being able to take charge and communicate with your team is essential for a manager to be successful. Also, as a manager, the job requires quick problem solving skills paired with educated decision making under pressure so that any issues or security threats can be avoided as soon as possible. Other skills needed for the job include planning ahead and taking on board new ideas or improvements. The experience required to become a manager of a cyber security team would be multiple years of experience in IT or Cyber Security. A minimum of 3-4 years of management experience in a technology security role would also be required, for example at a small scale company. Acceptable qualifications could be any tertiary courses in relation to Cyber Security or IT Security, or any online courses which can provide similar certifications and qualifications.
  </p>

  <p>At the moment, my experience is limited due to my decision to currently undertake a bachelors degree of Information Technology. Due to this, my experience is put on hold as I work towards achieving certifications and qualifications through my studies to assist with expanding my knowledge and resume for future job opportunities. The only experience I have is with my job at LG which involves experience in customer service, data entry, data management and accounting. However, I have had this job for approximately four months, with the first three being full time and this last month being part-time due to my full time University degree. Other than this introductory level job which may be a decent start for the IT field, I do not hold any other current experience. Even though I do not have a lot of experience in the field of Cyber Secuity or IT, I do feel as If I can convey a lot of the skills and characteristics of a manager. I do have experience over several leadership roles throughout my life, which were successful, meaning that I did generate other skills through these opportunities such as taking initiative, creating cohesion within a group, efficient planning and decisive problem solving.
  </p>

  <p>My plan is to continue working part-time at LG for the moment while I complete my degree in Information Technology. This is so that I can develop my customer service and team working skills while I get my certification in IT through my degree. Once I complete my degree, I would like to complete my masters in IT. I plan on working full time after this, hopefully I can get a job at a technology company, if not then I plan on working in customer service at a bank. From here, I plan on working my way up through experience so that I can land an IT role. If I can secure a position in IT, I plan on working there for a couple years, while I study on the side to get any certifications and qualifications still required to work in security, such as an MBA, but also for management, including online courses. Then I plan on achieving a job in IT/Cyber Security and eventually work my way up to manager.</p>


<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<img src="Personality test Results 2.png" alt="Personality Test Results" width="200px">
<img src="Type of Learning Test.png" alt="Type Of Learning Test Result" width="400px">
<img src="Type of Leader Test.png" alt="Type Of Leader Test Result" width="400px">
  <p>The first test, the Myers-Briggs test put my personality on display, through intricate questioning and several insightful aspects of the personality’s lifestyle. The personality assigned to me is known as ‘protagonist’. To me, this means that based off of the results of the test, I have an idealistic mindset, which means that I try do the right thing for myself and others no matter the cost. This can be a strength and a weakness as seeing the best in people can either help them shine or blind an individual from other people’s true selves. This personality also shows me that I am a natural born leader that is never afraid to step up whenever it is necessary. The second test, the learning style test, proved to myself that I am a visual learner, meaning the most efficient method of retaining information and comprehension of concepts for me is through visual stimuli. It means that I find it easier to visualise information to recall it. This also shows me that I can use visual stimuli to my advantage but that I also need to work on learning through auditory and tactile methods to increase the amount of things I can learn. Lastly, the test from the USC regarding different types of leaders suggested that I was a ‘Servant Leader’, meaning that in my eyes other people always come first. The results discussed assisting others in reaching their potential to create a strong unit of people, compared to individual strength. This means that I can listen and empathise for other people effectively while assisting them to find a path through their struggles. This can also be as an advantage in that it creates positivity in the community but also could be a disadvantage in that focusing so much on other people could be detrimental to myself.
  </p>

  <p>These results suggest that I am an individual who is a passive leader, in that I like to take control of situations if I feel I can improve. When working within a team the results suggest that I will be a leader that takes everyone’s ideas on board and will always be open to suggestions or changes. My behaviour would entail ensuring that everyone feels comfortable, understands their role, and assisting others as much as much as possible if needed. Since the results suggested I am a servant leader, I feel as if I would lead by serving in that I would complete the necessary work for my part, setting an example for the team. </p>

  <p>When forming a team, with my skillset and characteristics, the members of the team are required to be calm-minded, determined workers and willing to actively participate. Everyone should be willing to put in the work and cooperate responsibly. With the results from the test, it suggests that I can accompany most people in a team and make it function well. This means that when putting together a team it doesn’t matter too much who is in the group. It would be great to have another leader in an ideal group to be in control of the individuals of the group, while I can passively ensure everyone is comfortable and happy with their roles. </p>


<h2>Project Idea “Music Market”<h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>This project is a mobile application or website, serving the purpose of connecting millions of music creators and producers around the world to one service, that will be known as “Music Market”. The app will be a marketplace based on the trade of selling music, such as beats, instrumentals, lyrics, melodies and vocals. It involves an interaction of various users, from individuals looking to generate an income from selling their music and individuals who are looking to purchase music to add to their production. The project will encapsulate the processes behind the production of the app, the applications importance and the motivation behind it. Overall, the project ‘Music Market’ consists of the incorporation of buyers and/or sellers of music on a single platform to enhance the efficiency of the process. </p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

  <p>The idea for this project formed when my cousin and I were talking about purchasing some beats to rap over for our tracks. After doing some searching on SoundCloud and Youtube we realised it is difficult to purchase beats online. It usually involves a lot of back and forth messaging, signing of contracts, messy bank transfers and overall takes too long. Most of the time, it is difficult to tell which beats are available, which are used why multiple users, etc. So, to solve this tedious process of trading music, an easily accessible mobile phone application such as ‘Music Market’ can be implemented to make everyone’s life a little easier. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

  <p>The app will not be very complex in nature, to ensure the engagement of users through simplicity. Firstly, as most applications incorporate these days, a login is required. So, the application should ask to either ‘log in’ or ‘create an account’, which can be done through an email ID and password. The application or website has to be able to remember accounts and stay logged in, if the user wishes, to stay with the theme of simplicity through usability. </p>

  <p>Once an individual opens the application and is logged in, they will be taken to the home page. The home page will be known as the ‘browse’ page. This is where all the music for sale will be stored, it will be broken up into different sections such as: beats, lyrics, vocals, ad-libs, etc. The beats section will be separated into different genres and tempo of music so that users can be specific within browsing or explore various different sounds. This is obviously where users can preview the music briefly to see what they can purchase for their production. </p>

  <p>The bottom of the application will be divided into three interactive sections, the middle being the home page, the right one being the account page and the left one being the history page. </p>

  <p>The account page will be used for customising the account, including user-name, passwords, profile picture, payment methods and privacy. However, the essential use of the account page will be for the user’s music library, including their collection of all their music for sale and music purchased. Each piece of music, or ‘product’ will be listed separately with its individual price listing. The music will have three main features next to it, either ‘purchased’ meaning it has been bought, ‘for sale’ meaning it is available to buy and ‘draft’ for any music that has not been released for sale. Once music is sold or purchased, it is shown or will be updated to its current status within the account page. For exporting out of the app, music can be downloaded once shown here.</p>

  <p>The page on the complete left from the ‘page options’ on the bottom of the screen will be the history page. This page is mainly utilised for viewing and keeping record of any sales or purchases made by a user within the application. This page can also be utilised for viewing music that has been viewed previously by the user, incase they wish to re-visit the music. </p>

  <p>In the top right corner of the application will be the ‘chat’ option. This is where users can interact with each other from across the globe through messaging, incase any further details about the music are required to be discussed. </p>

  <p>In the top left corner of the application will be the ‘menu’ option, this includes the settings for the application. This could encompass a variety of options, such as favourites and specific filters. </p>

  <p>To tackle the issue of music being sold multiple times to various users, the price can be negotiated within the chat option, to a point where the music can be sold at an increased amount for exclusivity of the music. This is where both the buyer and seller mutually agree on a price for the rights of the music to be utilised only by the buyer. In regard to any profits made from any purchased music from the app, nothing will be owed to the seller unless a percentage of revenue for the music is formerly and mutually agreed upon by both the buyer and seller. </p>

  <p>For payment options, once any piece of music is selected, it must be added to the ‘shopping cart’. This is where a review of the products selected will be displayed, accompanied by payment options available to purchase the music. So for any seller of music, their payment details will be saved for incoming money after a sale, and for any buyer of music their payment details may be saved or input for the transfer of money to the seller. This can be done through various options such as: Shop pay, PayPal, Apple Pay, AfterPay and Klarna. </p>


<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>


  <p>The software required to develop the application would of course be the coding of the application, which is the computer language of the application os that it can be utilised across multiple devices. The hardware required to create the application would be a computer system with servers to store all the application’s code and information.</p>


<h3>Skills Required</h3>


  <p>Firstly, a project team is required to ensure the application is running smoothly. A manager will be required for the project team to ensure the users can communicate to the developer. User interface skills are also required to ensure the application is as easy as possible to utilise. Design skills are required to ensure the application is engaging to users so that the user levels are high and maintained. Communication skills are essential within the team to ensure any issues are resolved immediately. Coding languages such as HTML, C++ and Java are required to create the application and to communicate between one creator to another. Another essential skill for the application is security, this is so that any information from users are not illegally spread and shared. These skills are very reasonable within the field of IT, so it will not be difficult to either develop the skills through courses or teachers/tutors. </p>


<h3>Outcome</h3>

  <p>If the project ‘Music Market’ was running and successful, then the millions of music creators around the world could purchase musical elements to improve their music at any time and anywhere. It would be much more efficient to purchase and sell music once it is all on the same platform and is clearly labelled for all users. The app would save a lot of time for users as once the music is posted for sale, it can be purchased and be ready for use almost instantly with the features of the application. The app could change the way music is sampled and created forever if it were this easy to connect sounds from all over the globe so efficiently in one place, which would increase the rate and volume of which music is created at. </p>
